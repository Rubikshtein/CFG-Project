# Her Tech Hub 
## Code First Girls Web Development Course Project

👭 For the Web Development course project we decided to build a platform where women and non-binary individuals pursuing a career in tech can find useful resources, seek mentorship and connect with likeminded individuals to learn, inspire and empower each other. 

👩‍💻 This project showcases web development skills acquired in the program, such as **HTML**, **responsive web design** and **JavaScript**. The website does not contain real data or infomation and is for demonstration purposes only.
